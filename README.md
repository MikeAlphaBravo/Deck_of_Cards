# _Deck of Cards_

#### _Implementing a shuffle and card deck in Javascript, 02.17.2018_

#### By _Michael Brooks_

## Description

_I started off by reviewing my JavaScript notes from my coursework and Googling some examples of solutions to this problem.  It has been some time since I worked in a basic file structure and I needed a refresher as to how to set up my file structure in JS._
_My unfamiliarity with Java initially led me to build this in Ruby but then I felt JS was a better challenge for me and more applicable to the goal of the challenge.

_The goal of this app is to develop a deck of cards that has the ability by the user to be shuffled and drawn from._

## User Stories

* _As a user, I want to draw a card until the deck is empty._
* _As a user, I want to be able to shuffle the deck._
